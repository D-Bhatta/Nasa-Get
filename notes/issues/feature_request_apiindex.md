# API Index page

- Cards are displayed that show all the APIs that a user can access
- Each card has a picture, a heading corresponding to the API name, and a link to selected API page
- The app should show stuff in cards
- Each card should have a picture, a heading, and a link to a page
- The app should take the data to populate the cards from a data base
- Each card will open onto a new page with a particular id
