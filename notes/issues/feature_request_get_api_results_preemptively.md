# Get the results of API preemptively to save time

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Get the results of all APIs preemptively when someone clicks on API index

When someone clicks on the API index, get the API results and store them. This will save time.

This should be done in an encapsulated manner, so that there can be further development in this area.

**If the feature request is approved, would there be a need for further development in this area?**
Yes

This preemptive storage of data could be optimised further
